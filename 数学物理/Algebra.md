## 基础

| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Algbra $\mathcal{A}$ | vector space | multiplication                           |
|                      |              | $\exists b\in\mathcal{A}$ 使得 $ab = ba = e$ |
| 同态/同构                | 理想           |                                          |

### 理想

1. 子代数 $J\subset\mathcal{A}​$
2. $\forall a\in\mathcal{A}, aJ\subset\mathcal{A}, Ja\subset\mathcal{A}$

#### 定理

1. $e$ 具有逆元 $a$
2. 设$\mathcal{A}$是一个有幺元的代数，那么它的每一个理想$J$必含于某个极大理想之中

## $C^{*}$ Algebra

$C^{*}$ Algebras are self-adjoint operator algebras on Hilbert space which are closed in the norm topology 

> a commutative unital C∗-algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of complex valued continuous functions on a compact space – its spectrum 


## von Neumann Algebra

A von Neumann algebra is a self-adjoint unital subalgebra $M$ of the algebra of bounded operators of a Hilbert space which is closed in the weak operator topology 

> $M$ is closed in the weak operator topology if and only if it is equal to the commutant of its commutant 

## Operator Sapce
> noncommutative Banach space theory

+ An operator space is a closed subspace of a $\mathcal{C}^{*}$ algebra 
+ An operator system is a closed self-adjoint subspace of a unital $\mathcal{C}^{*}$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ which contains the unit of $\mathcal{A}$
